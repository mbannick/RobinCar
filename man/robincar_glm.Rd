\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame with the required columns}

\item{treat_col}{Name of column in df with treatment variable}

\item{response_col}{Name of the column in df with response variable}

\item{formula}{The formula to use for adjustment specified using as.formula("..."). This overrides car_strata_cols and covariate_cols.}

\item{car_strata_cols}{Names of columns in df with car_strata variables}

\item{car_scheme}{Name of the type of covariate-adaptive randomization scheme. One of: "simple", "pocock-simon", "biased-coin", "permuted-block".}

\item{g_family}{Family that would be supplied to glm(...), e.g., binomial. If no link specified, will use default link, like behavior in glm.
If you wish to use a negative binomial working model with an unknown dispersion parameter, then use `g_family="nb"`.}

\item{g_accuracy}{Level of accuracy to check prediction un-biasedness.}

\item{contrast_h}{An optional function to specify a desired contrast}

\item{contrast_dh}{An optional jacobian function for the contrast (otherwise use numerical derivative)}

\item{variance_type}{The type of variance estimator to use, type 1, 2, or 3. All three are asymptotically equivalent. See details for more.}
}
\value{
If `contrast_h` argument is used, outputs a `main` and a `contrast` object. The `main` object has the following structure:

 \item{result}{A \link[dplyr:tibble]{dplyr::tibble()} with the treatment label, treatment mean estimate using AIPW, estimated SE, and p-value based on a z-test with estimate and SE.}
 \item{varcov}{The variance-covariance matrix for the treatment mean estimates.}
 \item{settings}{List of model settings used in covariate adjustment.}
 \item{original_df}{The original dataset provided by the user.}
 \item{mod}{The fit from the \link[stats:glm]{glm()} working model used for covariate adjustment.}
 \item{mu_a}{Predicted potential outcomes for each treatment category (columns) and individual (rows). These are the \eqn{\hat{\mu}_a}}.
 \item{g.estimate}{The G-computation estimate based only on \eqn{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{\mu}_a(X_i)}. This is equivalent to the AIPW estimate when a canonical link function is used.}
 \item{data}{Attributes about the dataset.}

 The `contrast` object has a structure that is documented in \link[RobinCar:robincar_contrast]{RobinCar::robincar_contrast()}.

\description{
Estimate treatment-group-specific response means and (optionally)
treatment group contrasts using a generalized linear working model.
}
\details{
The output is the AIPW estimator given by (for each treatment group \eqn{a}):

\deqn{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{\mu}_a(X_i) + \frac{1}{n_a} \sum_{i:A_i=a} \{Y_i - \hat{\mu}(X_i)\}}

where \eqn{Y_i} is the outcome, \eqn{A_i} is the treatment assignment, \eqn{X_i} are the covariates, \eqn{n_a = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i=a},
and \eqn{\hat{\mu}_a} is the estimated conditional mean function based on the GLM working model.
This working model has treatment \eqn{a}-specific coefficients if `adj_method` is "heterogeneous". Otherwise, they are shared across the treatment arms.
Alternatively, if `formula` is used, the working model can be specified according to the user.

Importantly, the estimated variance accounts for misspecification of the working model, and for covariate-adaptive randomization.
The variance estimator is given by
\deqn{\hat{V} = \hat{V}_{\rm SR} - \hat{V}_{\Omega}}
where \eqn{\hat{V}_{\rm SR}} is the contribution to the variance under simple randomization, and \eqn{\hat{V}_{\Omega}} is a term
that only appears when a covariate-adaptive randomization scheme is used.
The \eqn{\hat{V}_{\Omega}} is the second line of \eqn{\hat{V}} in \link[=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10213]{Bannick et al. (2025)}.

There are three different estimators available for \eqn{\hat{V}_{\rm SR}}, which the user
can choose with the argument \code{variance_type}. We describe these here.

The three variance types are given as follows:

\itemize{
 \item{
   Type 1 (default):
   \deqn{\mathrm{diag}\left[\hat{\pi}_a^{-1} (\mathrm{Var}_a(Y_i) - 2\hat{Q}_{a,a} + \hat{\Sigma}_{a,a} ), a = 1, \dots, K \right] + \hat{Q} + \hat{Q}^T - \hat{\Sigma}}
 }
 \item{
   Type 2:
   \deqn{\mathrm{diag}\left[\hat{\pi}_a^{-1} (\mathrm{Var}_a(Y_i - \hat{\mu}_a(X_i)) - 2\hat{Q}_{a,a} + \hat{\Sigma}_{a,a} ), a = 1, \dots, K \right] + \hat{Q} + \hat{Q}^T - \hat{\Sigma}}
 }
 \item{
   Type 3:
   \deqn{\mathrm{diag}\left[\hat{\pi}_a^{-1} E_a([Y_i - \hat{\mu}_a(X_i)]^2), a = 1, \dots, K \right] + \hat{A}}
 }
}

where \eqn{\hat{\pi}_a} is the treatment proportion for group a,
\eqn{\hat{Q}_{a,b} = \mathrm{Cov}_a(Y_i, \hat{\mu}_b(X_i))},
\eqn{\hat{\Sigma}_{a,b} = \mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\mu}_a(X_i), \hat{\mu}_b(X_i))},
and the matrix \eqn{\hat{A}} has diagonal entries for \eqn{(a, a)} given by
\deqn{2\mathrm{Cov}_a(Y_i - \hat{\mu}_a(X_i), \hat{\mu}_a(X_i)) + \mathrm{Var}_a(\hat{\mu}_a(X_i))}
and off-diagonal entries for \eqn{(a, b)} given by
\deqn{\mathrm{Cov}_a(Y_i, \hat{\mu}_b(X_i)) + \mathrm{Cov}_b(Y_i, \hat{\mu}_a(X_i)) - (1/2) \left[\mathrm{Cov}_a(\hat{\mu}_a(X_i), \hat{\mu}_b(X_i)) + \mathrm{Cov}_b(\hat{\mu}_a(X_i), \hat{\mu}_b(X_i)) \right].}
We use \eqn{E_a}, \eqn{\mathrm{Var}_a}, and \eqn{\mathrm{Cov}_a} to refer to the empirical expectation, variance, and
 covariance among observations in group a only, and \eqn{\mathrm{Cov}} is the covariance within
the entire sample.

Please see the Supplemental Material Sect. H of \link[=https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asaf029]{Bannick et al. (2025)} for a discussion
of the merits of each type of variance estimator. Briefly, we recommend
variance types 1 generally, and variance type 3 if it is anticipated
that the distribution of \eqn{X} varies substantially over treatment groups.
